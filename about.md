I'm a newcomer to the world of scripting and coding, brought here by a passion for automation and laziness (It's probably a 70/30 split). I've decided to share some of my work and findings here in an attempt to be able to contribute to a community that has been excessively helpful. I hope that some of my "Aha!" moments or simple projects will help someone else on their own journey.

### More Information

I currently reside in Canada, where I spend most of my time insde because bears.
